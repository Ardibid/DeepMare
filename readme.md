## VR Experience with Style Transfer <br>
This is my final project for 15-112 course at CMU School of Computer Science. It was awarded the best project prize for Fall 2016. <br>
this project was developed before Tnsorflow became available for Windows and before any VR support for MacOSX.

### Architecture:<br>

(At the time, Windows was not supported by Tensorflow and VR was not supported on MacOS)<br>

This project uses Neural Style by Anish Athalye to apply Style Transfer of a panoramic images. Then it uses a 360-degree image viewer inspired by PhotosphereViewer, with UI implemented in Unity to view the images in VR.
